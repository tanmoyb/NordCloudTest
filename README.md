# NordCloudTest

Runnable with Node Js

Run Command: node nordcloudTest.js


Problem solving
Create a function that solves the most suitable (with most power) link
station for a device at given point [x,y]. Use JavaScript runnable in modern
browser or Node.js.
This problem can be solved in 2-dimensional space. Link stations have reach and
power.
A link station’s power can be calculated:
power = (reach - device's distance from link station)^2
if distance > reach, power = 0
Function receives list of link stations and the point where the device is
located.
Function should output following line:
“Best link station for point x,y is x,y with power z”
Or:
“No link station within reach for point x,y”
Link stations are located at points (x, y) and have reach (r) ([x, y, r]):
[[0, 0, 10],
[20, 20, 5],
[10, 0, 12]]
Print out function output from points (x, y): (0,0), (100, 100), (15,10) and (18, 18).
